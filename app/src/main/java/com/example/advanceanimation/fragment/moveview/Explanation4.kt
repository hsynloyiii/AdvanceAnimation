/*
Objects on screen will often need to repositioned due to user interaction or some processing behind the scenes
    instead of immediately updating the objects position, we should use an animation to move it from the starting to its end position
    Android provides ways to reposition our view objects on screen such as the ObjectAnimator, we can provide the end position we want
    the object to settle on (mostaqar shvd)


Change view position with ObjectAnimator => is in the withObjectAnimator()
    The ObjectAnimator provides an easy way to change the properties of a view (as we learned before)
